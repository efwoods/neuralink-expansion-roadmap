## Phase 1

I am considering using multimodel data of ECoG & EEG to drive an Nvidia simulation of a humanoid robot. The data would be used to train models with respect to motion of the joints of the humanoid robot. The data would be used to create synthetic generative models of the data. The generated synthetic data would be sent to an api for decoding using the models and the coordinates would be sent to the Nvidia simulation to articulate movment. The Nvidia Simulation would also be able to run independently and send coordinates to an api that generates synthetic data based upon the movements of the simulated humanoid robot. The Ultimate goal is to create a real-world Ninja Warrior Competition where individuals are neuralinked, their performance is detected by the neuralink and used later for model creation, the neuralink may stimulate movement for individuals to articulate movement completely, and the neuralink would be used to increase metrics of individuals by anticipating movements and sending written signals to increase speed or longevity of movements such that they become hyper-performant. 

I want to have neuralink data in individuals to collect human movement, use this data to train models of motion, anticipate movement, and increase human movement and performance in those that are unable or those that are seeking competitive performance. 

I want to use this in Formula-1 to increase the reactive speed of drivers.  I am focused on creating a system that is universally applicable, feasible, and leverages the successes of one application to be applied to other applications. I want to aid those that need aid, increase performance for those that are competitive, and in doing so I will have created the foundation for all features of motion such that there are features that will be applicable to the general public.

## Phase 2

That is Phase 1. Phase 2 is coordinated movement of multiple users. Proof of concept is Cirque de Solei where each performer is Neuralinked and the movements are coordinated by an overarching server process.  


## Financial & Timeline Planning and Scaling

What is the timeline and financial cost of all phases of this project? I want a report where I iteratively add features:

Neuralink-controlled amygdala passive animals for zoos
Neuralink-controlled amygdala passive prisoners for forgiven prisoners who would have been on death row

Neuralink-controlled inner-though, touch, movement, vision, hearing
Neuralink-augmented inner-though, touch, movement, vision, hearing

Neuralink-controlled group movement

please provide this for all afformentioned components in both phases for individual scale for those in need, individual scale for those seeking hyper-performance, individual scale for the general population looking for exciting features and applications,  and phase 2 group scale for the same from small groups to the limit of 8 billion individuals. I believe this process results in world peace.
